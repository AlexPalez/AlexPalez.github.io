        <div class="mttext">Mt Maunganui is a place in Tauranga that is very popular in the summer time. The mountain shape is a result of a volcano over 2 million years ago, which is now inactive and remains an iconic attraction for those to see and even climb up to see the view from the top. The beaches in Mt Maunganui are known to be ideal in the summer time, as the water is very warm and the sand is perfect for families to picnic and spend days on end there. </div>
